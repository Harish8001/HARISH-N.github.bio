     <br>
• Developed GIP payment functionality in the OBDX application using JAX-WS and the JSON library for real-time payment
services. Implemented a scheduler class to manage regular checks on payment status through third-party APIs, facilitating
seamless database updates upon successful payments. Ensured accuracy by orchestrating a reverse process, triggering third-party
API calls for payment reversal and subsequent database updates.<br><br>
• Integrated Western Union payment functionality into the OBDX application leveraging the OKhttp client library. Successfully
interfaced with third-party SOAP APIs for seamless communication and processing of Western Union payments.
• Utilized OBDX framework features to set transaction limits and incorporate a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism for
Western Union payment transactions.<br><br>
• Developed a dynamic user interface for the Western Union payment screen, customizing the appearance and functionality based
on country corridors.<br><br>
• Implemented SMS integration for seamless communication with users during various transactions, including payments, password
resets, and other banking requests. Configured the system to send one-time passwords (OTPs) to the registered mobile numbers
to enhance security and user verification processes.
• Contributed to all phases of the development lifecycle and have a keen eye for identifying and addressing both production and
non-production application issues.
